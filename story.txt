The rusted knight walked past the fallow fields and husked buildings. A layer of rust coated everything and the ghosts of memories hinted what the town was. From the barren ash, the town rose and became a beacon for all those after calamity, but once again returned to ash. The only record of its legacy was in the aching scars of the knight. His once silver armor, emblamatic of highest guard of the land, was tarnished and dented from the decades of sin. At the knight's hip was a broken sword. The once mighty longsword was inscribed with the message "Vigolo, Confido", an empty message. These were the only items the knight could claim his own as his memories and name were lost to the ether. The only thing the knight could do was to walk in a desolate land without purpose, defending himself from the abominations that were once man. Stirring from the knight from the emptiness of his head, he heard a sound stirring from one of the houses, but it was not that of a beast.
